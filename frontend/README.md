# GreedyBear - frontend

Built with [@certego/certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui).

## Design thesis

- Re-usable components/hooks/stores that other projects can also benefit from should be added to [certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui) package.
- GreedyBear specific:
  - components should be added to `src/components`.
  - general hooks should be added to `src/hooks`.
  - zustand stores hooks should be added to `src/stores`.

## Local Development Environment

The frontend inside the docker containers does not hot-reload, so
you need to use `CRA dev server` on your host machine to serve pages when doing development on the frontend, using docker nginx only as API source.

- Start GreedyBear containers (see [docs](https://greedybear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html)). Original dockerized app is accessible on `http://localhost:80`

- If you have not `node-js` installed, you have to do that. Follow the guide [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04). We tested this with NodeJS >=16.6

- Install npm packages locally

```bash
cd ./frontend && npm install
```

- Start CRA dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

- Now you can access the auto-reloading frontend on `http://localhost:3001`. It acts as proxy for API requests to original app web server.

- JS app main configs are available in `package.json` and `enviroments.js`.
