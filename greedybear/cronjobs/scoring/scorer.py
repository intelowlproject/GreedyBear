    Abstract base class for implementing scoring mechanisms.

    This class serves as a template for different scoring implementations,
    enforcing a consistent interface while allowing flexible implementations.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Identifier for the scorer instance
        score_name (str): Name of the score this implementation produces
        trainable (bool): Indicates if the scorer requires/supports training

    Methods:
        score(df): Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
