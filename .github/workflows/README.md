## [Reusable detect changes workflow](_detect_changes.yml)

This sub workflow detects and enumerates the changes between two branches.

It is composed of five steps:

1. **Check out PR target branch** - This step checks out the latest commit of the PR target branch for the current repository. This workflow was designed to detect changes when a PR to a target branch was created. Therefore, the latest commit of the target branch must be checked out as the first step. To achieve this, GitHub's [**checkout**](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action is used with the following parameters:
   1. **ref** - The branch, tag or SHA to checkout - It is set to `github.base_ref`, which corresponds to the **PR target branch**.
2. **Check out source branch latest commit** - This step checks out the latest commit of the source branch on top of the previous one. To do so, GitHub's [**checkout**](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action is used with the following parameters:
   1. **clean** - Whether to execute `git clean -ffdx && git reset --hard HEAD` before fetching - It is set to false, which means **do not delete untracked files**.
3. **Generate summary** - This step creates the title for the action summary. As a matter of fact, the detected changes will be reported below the title in the summary section. The step is performed only if one or both *backend_directories* and *frontend_directories* inputs are not empty.
4. **Generate diffs for backend** - This step detects and enumerates the files that changed between the two branches. This is performed using [`git diff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) command. Specifically, the code instructs git to show the changes in the *backend_directories* relative to `origin/<github.base_ref>` (the target branch). During this process, the [**pathspec**](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) is used to exclude files or directories specified in the *backend_exclusions* input. The changes are then enumerated and output through the *backend* variable.
5. **Generate diffs for frontend** - This step follow the same pattern as the **Generate diffs for backend** step but for the frontend directories.

### Documentation

## [Reusable node tests workflow](_node.yml)

This sub workflow install node dependencies and run frontend linters and tests.

It is composed of nine steps:

1. **Check out latest commit for current branch** - This step checks out the latest commit for the current branch of the repository. To do so, it uses GitHub's [**checkout**](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action with no parameters.
2. **Set up Node.js** - This step sets Node.js up downloading binaries and project's dependencies. This is done using the GitHub's [**setup-node**](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) action which also allows to cache and restore the project dependencies. It's used with the following parameters:

   2. *use_react*
   3. *use_eslint*
   4. *use_prettier*
   5. *use_stylelint*

5. **Run linters** - This step uses [**node_linter**](../actions/node_linter/action.yml) action to run linters against the frontend source code.
6. **Check packages licenses** - This step uses [**pilosus/action-pip-license-checker**](https://github.com/pilosus/action-pip-license-checker) to check the licenses used by the project requirements.
7. **Run CodeQL** - This step uses [**codeql**](../actions/codeql/action.yml) action to run CodeQL to discover vulnerabilities across the codebase.
8. **Run custom command** - This step is performed only if the input variable *custom_command* is not empty. The step simply run the bash command described in the previously mentioned input variable in the working directory specified by the *working_directory* input variable.
9. **Run jest tests** - This step runs Jest tests if the input variable *use_jest* is set to true. Finally, if *use_coverage* and *upload_coverage* are set to true, a coverage report is generated and uploaded.

## [Create APT cache](create_apt_cache.yaml)

This workflow is run in the event of **a push on branches *main*, *master*, *develop*, *dev***. Specifically, it is triggered only when the APT requirements file is updated.

The workflow is composed of a single job:

1. **Create cache for APT dependencies** - This job, as described by its name, creates a cache for APT dependencies and stores it on GitHub. It is composed of four steps:
   1. **Check out latest commit on current branch** - This step checks out the latest commit on the current branch of the repository.
   2. **Install APT dependencies** - This step refreshes APT repositories and then install the project dependecies. This action is required to produce the APT cache that will be saved later.
   3. **Save APT cache** - This step saves APT cache on GitHub. The GitHub's [**save_apt_cache**](../actions/apt_requirements/save_apt_cache/README.md) action is used.

## [Create Python cache](create_python_cache.yaml)

This workflow is run in the event of **a push on branches *main*, *master*, *develop*, *dev***. Specifically, it is triggered only when the Python requirements file is updated.

The workflow is composed of a single job:

1. **Create cache for Python dependencies** - This job, as described by its name, creates a cache for Python dependencies and stores it on GitHub. It is composed of four steps:
   1. **Check out latest commit** - This step checks out the latest commit on the current branch for the repository.
   2. **Install system dependencies required by Python Packages** - **OPTIONAL** - Sometimes, Python packages require one or more system dependencies. For instance, `python-ldap` Python package requires `libldap2-dev` and `libsasl2-dev`, System dependencies, for a successful installation. This step allows user to install system dependencies required by Python packages.
   3. **Set up Python** - This step install Python on the runner.
   4. **Set up Python virtual environment** - This step uses [**create_virtualenv**](../actions/python_requirements/create_virtualenv/README.md) action to create a Python virtual environment.
   5. **Install Python dependencies** - This step install Python requirements to produce the final virtual environment that will be cached. Also, installing the Python dependencies, creates the pip cache.
   6. **Save pip cache** - This step uses [**save_pip_cache**](../actions/python_requirements/save_pip_cache/README.md) action to save pip's download cache on GitHub.
   7. **Create virtual environment cache** - This step uses [**save_virtualenv**](../actions/python_requirements/save_virtualenv/README.md) action to save virtual environment on GitHub's cache.

## [CI](pull_request_automation.yml)

This workflow runs in the case of a **pull request on branches *master*, *main*, *develop*, *dev*** and it's the core CI workflow.

It is composed of three jobs:

1. **detect-changes** - This job detects and enumerates changes to backend and/or frontend files. To do so, it uses the [**_detect_changes**](_detect_changes.yml) workflow.
2. **node** - If any changes to the frontend files are found, [**_node**](_node.yml) workflow is run.
3. **python** - If any changes to the backend files are found, [**_python**](_python.yml) workflow is run.
